A repository for algorithm-a-night posts. Just a collection of beautiful algorithms or data structures that I find and spend some time with.

## Night 1: PRNGs and Monte Carlo techniques

This post is a little basic but discusses linear shift feedback registers and using pseudorandom numbers to perform numerical integration. 'Monte Carlo' refers to the class of algorithms which are probably correct. The probabilistic margin of error can be reduced by repeated iteration of the algorithm.
